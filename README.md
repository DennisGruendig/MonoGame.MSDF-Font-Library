# MonoGame.MSDF_Font_Library
A font library which allows the MonoGame content manager to import font files directly, so that they can be rendered, using a [Multi-Channel Distance Fields](http://inter-illusion.com/assets/I2SmartEdgeManual/SmartEdge.html?MultiChannelDistanceFields.html) Shader.

The fonts are dynamically scalable with minimal quality losses while still being relatively light weight on the processor, since most of the calculations are Computed in a shader.

This project is based on the work of Viktor Chlumsk√Ω found in his MSDF-Generator Projects, specifically [MSDF-Atlas-Gen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdf-atlas-gen).

Since this is still work in progress and it is actually my first public repository, I am thankful for any kind of productive feedback!
